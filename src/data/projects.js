    description: "Created a basic multi-module CPU model using SystemVerilog and tested it on the FPGA.",
    longDescription: "I created a basic multi-module CPU model consisting of 9 modules using SystemVerilog and validated it using ModelSim. The CPU consisted of modules such as ALU, Decoder, IMEM, DMEM, which were validated to work at a clock frequency of 50MHz. The CPU was then tested on a Cyclone V FPGA using Quartus Prime, where it was able to fetch and execute instructions from memory, and perform basic arithmetic operations.",

    longDescription: "I built a simple neural network using C++ to predict a decimal output from a given binary input. The neural network is a feedforward neural network with 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer. The input layer consists of 4 neurons, the hidden layer consists of 8 neurons, and the output layer consists of 16 neurons. The input layer is connected to the hidden layer by a weight matrix, and the hidden layer is connected to the output layer by a weight matrix. The neural network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm. The neural network is trained with a 4 bit binary input and a 1 bit decimal output. The neural network is able to predict the decimal output from the binary input with an accuracy of 90% after the training.",

    title: "Button Presser System",
    description: "Created a button presser system using an Arduino Nano that presses a button a certain number of times with a set time interval.",
    longDescription: "I created a button presser circuit using an Arduino Nano, a servo motor, a DS3231 RTC module. I programmed the Arduino to press the button 3 times every 2 hours using Arduino IDE.\n\nAs using delays to keep track of time would be power inefficient, I used the DS3231 RTC module to keep track of time. To enhance the power efficiency of the system, and to improve my experience with using interrupts, I used interrupts to detect the time interval, which woke the Arduino Nano module from sleep mode using the interrupt.\n\nI then turned the whole system into a PCB using KiCad, where I designed the footprints for the components myself to get the correct fit for all the components.\n\nOne problem I faced was because of the servo motor being connected to the 3.3V pin of the Arduino Nano. When the servo motor moved, it caused a current spike in the 3.3V rail, which forced the Nano to restart itself. I solved this problem by placing a decoupling capacitor parallel to the 3.3V rail.",

    title: "Simple DC Voltage Source using a Microcontroller and a DAC and PID Control",
    description: "Built a microcontroller based DC voltage source using a Digital-to-Analog Converter using PWM and implemented PID control via UART.",
    longDescription: "Using Il-Matto -a microcontroller development board designed in the University of Southampton- I built a simple DC voltage source. To do this, I created a PWM signal using the microcontroller's timer, and connected this signal to a basic low-pass filter to create a DC voltage signal, whose voltage was dependent on the duty cycle of the PWM signal. I then made a PID controller to control the voltage output, and fed the voltage output back into the microcontroller through the microcontroller's ADC input. Using the voltage readings from the ADC, the PID controller was able to control the voltage output to maintain a stable voltage under varying load conditions. A UART interface was also implemented to allow the user to set the voltage output value they want, and display the voltage output value on the screen without needing a multimeter or an oscilloscope.",
